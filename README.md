# Image-Segmentation-Remote-Sensing
Remote sensing involves acquiring information about objects or areas from a distance, often through aircraft or satellites. This project focuses on labeling house roofs using image segmentation based on satellite images. What makes this project intriguing is the constraint of having only a limited set of labeled images (around 20). Addressing this challenge necessitates the application of **transfer learning** techniques.
