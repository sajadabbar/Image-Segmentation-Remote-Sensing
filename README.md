Disclaimer: While primarily designed for personal record-keeping purposes, this notebook may prove beneficial to readers exploring image segmentation through transfer learning techniques. It could be particularly useful for those with an interest in remote sensing applications.


Remote sensing involves acquiring information about objects or areas from a distance, often through aircraft or satellites. This project focuses on labeling house roofs using image segmentation based on satellite images. What makes this project intriguing is the constraint of having only a limited set of labeled images (around 20). Addressing this challenge necessitates the application of **transfer learning** techniques.
